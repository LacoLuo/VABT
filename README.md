# Vision-Aided Beam Tracking:
A project dedicated to the problem of mmWave beam tracking using machine learning and computer vision. Two machine learning solutions will be posted, one learns beam tracking from only previously-observed beams, and the second learns the same task from previously-observed beams and images.

COMING SOON. STAY TUNED... ;-)
